# fovtester

I need to get up to speed on Unity 5.4 anyway, so this is a simple project to try out some new stuff and to also create a useful app relatively quickly.

This app will let you look at an image and color in and export your personal FOV for each device.

R      Recenter


TODO:
* Make sure FOV math is correct?
* Add Controller support (allow coloring of fov)
* Export Image
