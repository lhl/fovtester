# fovtester

I need to get up to speed on Unity 5.4 anyway, so this is a simple project to try out some new stuff and to also create a useful app relatively quickly.

This app will let you look at an image and color in and export your personal FOV for each device.

```
R      Recenter
L      Lock or unlock
Enter  Export
C      Clear/Reset

Use the controller and either hit 'a' or pull the trigger to color
```
